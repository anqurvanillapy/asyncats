This repository contains my exercise codes of asynchronous socket programming in
different programming languages, especially using some built-in features (e.g.
from standard library) for asynchronicity instead of third-party packages.

**Notice:** Socket API is not overwhelmingly supported in every programming
language's standard library, hence some of the code will share a totally
different style to implement an asynchronous echo server.
